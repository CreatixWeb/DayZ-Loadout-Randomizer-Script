# DayZ-Loadout-Randomizer-Script
This DayZ Custom Loadout Script customizes weather, economy, and loadouts by class (e.g., nurse, soldier). Each role has unique gearâ€”nurses carry medical supplies but lack warmth; soldiers have weapons and cold protection. No mod files needed; overwrites init.c directly. Extendable for realism and strategy.
